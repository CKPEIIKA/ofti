# of_tui – OpenFOAM TUI

`of_tui` is a small curses-based tool to browse and edit OpenFOAM case dictionaries.

> Disclaimer: this project has been vibe coded and is under heavy development. Expect rough edges, rapid changes, and incomplete features. Better fork and do it better!

## Usage

1. Source your OpenFOAM environment so `foamDictionary` (and other foam* tools) are on `PATH`.
2. From a source checkout, run the CLI module directly (the example case is in `of_example`):

   ```bash
   python -m of_tui.cli ./of_example
   ```

   After installing the package via `pip install .`  use the console script:

   ```bash
   of_tui ./of_example
   ```

   To install straight from this GitHub repo without cloning:

   ```bash
   pip install "git+https://github.com/<your-user>/OpenFOAM-TUI.git"
   # then
   of_tui /path/to/case
   ```

3. Optional flags:

   - `--debug` – enable debug logging and let unexpected errors surface with a traceback.

## Main navigation

- `j` / `k` or arrows: move up/down in menus and lists
- `l` or `Enter`: select
- `h` or `q`: go back / quit (on the root menu, only `q` quits)
- `/` in menus: fuzzy-pick an option with `fzf` (when available)

Main menu entries:

- `Editor` – browse `system`, `constant`, and `0*` dictionaries and edit entries.
- `Check syntax` – run a simple `foamDictionary`-based check over all discovered dictionaries.
- `Tools` – run common solvers/utilities, job helpers, and view logs.
- `Diagnostics` – run `foamSystemCheck`, `foamInstallationTest`, `checkMesh`.
- `Global search` – (shown only when `fzf` is available) search across all keys with `fzf` and jump to the chosen entry.

The main menu renders a FOAM-style banner that shows the case folder, solver, OpenFOAM environment version, case-header version, latest time directory, and absolute path so you always know which case is loaded.

## Editor and entry browser

- In the editor, pick a section (`system`, `constant`, `0*`), then a file, then an entry.
- Left pane: list of keys; right pane: preview of the selected entry (key path, type, value, comments, info).
- Status bar: shows case name, file, and full key path.
- When browsing `boundaryField` entries, the preview automatically shows the detected boundary-condition type and value (queried via `foamDictionary`).

Keybindings in the entry browser:

- `j` / `k` or arrows: move between entries
- `l` / `Enter` / `e`: edit the current entry
- `h` / `Left` / `q`: go back (or up one dictionary level)
- `v`: view the full file
- `o`: open the current entry in `$EDITOR` and write back on save
- `/`: search entries with `fzf` (when available), otherwise simple in-file search

Keybindings in the entry editor:

- Arrow keys: move the cursor in the input line
- `Backspace`: delete at the cursor
- `Enter`: save the new value (with validation and a confirmation prompt if the value looks dangerous)
- `Ctrl+C` or `b`: cancel editing
- `h`: run `foamHelp` with user-provided arguments and show the result in a viewer

Values are auto-formatted conservatively on save (e.g. trimming trailing newlines and leading/trailing spaces on simple scalars) before being written back with `foamDictionary -set`. The editor also surfaces extra metadata gathered from `foamDictionary -info/-list` (enum values, required sub-entries) plus boundary-condition summaries for `boundaryField`.

## Tools and diagnostics

- `Tools`
  - Built-in entries for `blockMesh`, `decomposePar`, `reconstructPar`, `foamListTimes`, `foamCheckJobs`, `foamPrintJobs`, and the `foamJob` / `foamEndJob` helpers.
  - Extra commands can be added via `of_tui.tools`; optional post-processing commands live in `of_tui.postprocessing` and appear prefixed with `[post]`.
  - `postProcess (prompt)` and `foamCalc (prompt)` capture arguments interactively, defaulting to `-latestTime` when it makes sense.
  - `Run current solver (runApplication)` sources `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/tools/RunFunctions` and runs the solver declared in `system/controlDict`.
  - Cleanup helpers (`Remove all logs`, `Clean time directories`, `Clean case`) source `$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/tools/CleanFunctions`.
  - `Run .sh script` discovers shell scripts in the case directory; `foamDictionary (prompt)` offers an escape hatch for arbitrary queries.
  - Any entry from `of_tui.tools`/`of_tui.postprocessing` can use the placeholder `{{latestTime}}` which expands to the numerically largest time directory.
- `Diagnostics`:
  - `foamSystemCheck`, `foamInstallationTest`, `checkMesh`
  - `View logs` – pick a `log.*` file and either view the full log or just the last 100 lines

All tool runs show a summary with the command, exit status, stdout, and stderr in a scrollable viewer.

## Repository layout

- `of_tui/` – Python package that provides the CLI (`of_tui.cli:main`) and all runtime modules:
  - `app.py` – curses entry point, menus, editor/browser glue.
  - `editor.py` – entry editor UI and file viewer.
  - `menus.py` – shared menu widgets (with `fzf` integration).
  - `openfoam.py` – wrappers around `foamDictionary`, RunFunctions helpers, syntax checks.
  - `tools.py` – tools/diagnostics implementations.
  - `domain.py`, `validation.py` – supporting types and validators.
- `tests/` – pytest suite (unit + optional integration).
- `of_example/` – small example OpenFOAM case for experimentation.
- `TODO.md` – roadmap of remaining P2/P3 items.

## Development

Requirements:

- Python 3.11+ (tested with 3.11).
- `pytest` for running tests.
- A working OpenFOAM environment for runtime usage (for tests that touch OpenFOAM, see the optional integration test).

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

You can work directly from a clone of this repository; no packaging step is required. Run the CLI via:

```bash
python -m of_tui.cli /path/to/case
```
